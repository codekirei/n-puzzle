An n-puzzle (e.g. [15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)) written with basic web tech .

## Tech Requirements:

- no third party libs other than jQuery
- IE9+ compatibility
- responsive
- touch compatible
- no build process &mdash; just raw html, css, and js

## Functional Requirements:

- randomized starting tile locations
- game is solvable by moving tiles around
- tiles that should not be movable are not movable
- a scoreboard that tracks turns taken

## Nice-to-haves:

- easily switch between n counts (e.g. 8-puzzle)
- touch and mouse dragging interaction for tiles
